into a text-to-text format. Due to the scale of the pretrained dataset C4, the T5 is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classficiation, and more. \n","\n","T5 works well on a variety of tasks out-of-the-box by prepending a different prefix to the input corresponding to each task, e.g. for translation: translate English to German:..., for summarization: summarize...\n","\n","T5 uses [relative scalar embeddings](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17654). Encoder input padding can be done on the left and on the right. \n","\n","\n","---\n","### Training\n","\n","T5 is trained using [teacher forcing](https://machinelearningmastery.com/teacher-forcing-for-recurrent-neural-networks/). This means that for training, we always need an input sequence and a corresponding target sequence. The input sequence is fed to the model using input_ids. The target sequence is shifted to the right, i.e. prepended by a start-sequence token and fed to the decoder using the decoder_input_ids. In teacher-forcing style, the target sequence is then appended by the EOS token and corresponds to the labels. The PAD token is hereby used as the start-sequence token. T5 can be trained / fine-tuned both in a supervised and unsupervised fashion. \n","\n","---\n","### Training tips\n","\n","*   T5 models need a slightly higher learning rate than the default one set in the Trainer when using the AdamW optimizer. (e.g. 1e-4, 3e-4) Note: T5 was pre-trained using the AdaFactor optimizer\n","*   Task prefixes should be considered if the task is similar or related to one of the supervised tasks used in T5's pre-training mixture. \n","\n","---\n","### Youtube-Videos\n","*   [The Transformer Architecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQQlZhbC5ps&t=225s)\n","*   [The Transformer Architecture 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S27pHKBEp30&t=633s)\n","*   [Introduction to the T5 Transformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKqWC577WlI&t=760s)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":41,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":49,"referenced_widgets":["70f28c69610842279c83f3bec9ffbfaa","a5d142db8cf341fab97327dc784f5b3c","3d720598f8a544f38266c032308051f5","850e176989844976b83067d8f584d8f1","09c8aea750604550a48ef35b9d289b72","40bf008c4182418b941990689170bf66","8d50b5d3af5c43059a2efef39547a97f","f37b87807f864de2a10fb4a2ac08761e","5f7b4b05f2f0412298c2534475a01daa","f6d29bddc92c4efbaa6f6f48bf054f35","08290ac073584a388a0e75692f35e302"]},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":27261,"status":"ok","timestamp":1645365183391,"user":{"displayName":"zhuole lee","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi_pwhnGeXTt6vKnrwfw8OJch51aUvgd1RGcRtW=s64","userId":"10882830229263452777"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"U4gZv9hoObZO","outputId":"589609cc-286e-45da-9070-78b48c0bf9cf"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"70f28c69610842279c83f3bec9ffbfaa","version_minor":0,"version_major":2},"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/850M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{}}],"source":["model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME, return_dict = True)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":42,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1179,"status":"ok","timestamp":1645365470146,"user":{"displayName":"zhuole lee","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi_pwhnGeXTt6vKnrwfw8OJch51aUvgd1RGcRtW=s64","userId":"10882830229263452777"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"m_UGoE6QOba7","outputId":"e3358526-70b1-498d-a7f4-83cbf5ff2185"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["tensor([[    0,  1674,  2010,   732,   177,  9644,  2221,   510,     3, 11938,\n","           195,    15,     7, 14572,    35, 29484,     5,     1]])"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":42}],"source":["# Example task 1: translate english to german\n","input_ids = tokenizer(\n","    \"translate English to German: I've learned a lot about machine learning through the workshop\",        #
